PROBLEMS:
seems that manual perturbation is needed during the application of the method (supplementary files)
1. currency selection
2. how many iterations (which size of subnets is good!) -> nearly like cutting a hierarchical clustering tree
3. accepting external metabolites suggested at each step! (or as a one-off selection)

Dear Abolfazl
 
Thank you for your interest in my work.
All files implementing my Netsplitter procedure are available for download from Bionformatics.org, at the url http://www.bioinformatics.org/groups/?group_id=1067 .
Let me know if you experience any problems in downloading or running it on your models.
