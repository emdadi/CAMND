function [ vmods, fmods ] = interestingModules( model, flux, modules, nutrient, notshow )
%PARTITIONMODULES find the interesting modules of a given network
%   This method filters out the interesting modules of reactions with
%   variable flux rates, i.e. modules without any net-production are dropped 
%   (they correspond to thermodynamically infeasible cycles or are
%   uncoupled to the whole system).
%   Additionally, the set of fixed reactions is grouped into modules. After
%   not-show metabolites and all reactions with variable flux rate are
%   removed from the system, the remaining network may decompose into
%   several connected components. These connected components are then
%   identified as the fixed modules.
%
%   Input:
%    model    - the model (COBRA format)
%    flux     - a feasible flux through the network
%    modules  - a decomposition of the network (variable reactions) into modules
%    nutrient - a list of reaction IDs that should be explicitely depcited
%    notshow  - a list of metabolite IDs of metabolites that should be
%                   hidden (e.g. h2o or h)
%   Output:
%    vmods    - selected modules with reactions of variable flux rates
%    fmods    - selected modules with reactions of fixed flux rates
