function [modules, var] = computeModules( model )
%COMPUTEMODULES Computes the modules of this model
% Input:
%		model 			model to compute modules for (COBRA format)
%	
%	Output:
%		modules 		logical matrix with columns corresponding to modules and rows corresponding to reactions
%								each column has true for each reaction contained in the module and false otherwise
%								the matrix only contains the modules of reactions with variable flux rate
%		var					matrix with 2 columns. The first column gives minimal flux rates, the second gives maximal flux rates for each reaction

% This is ugly (but we have to choose some error tolerances)!
% If the algorithm does not work for you, try to play with these values. Numerical instabilities can cause weird results.
epsilon = 1e-7;
model.precision = 1e-8; % only important for method 1,2
model.dual_precision = 1e-8; % only important for method 1,2

% run FVA to find fixed reactions
% Choose the method that you want to use. 

% method 1,2: 	use the fva feature of the metaopt toolbox. 
%								This allows us to solve FVA with higher precision and faster than the cobra toolbox.
%								The metaopt toolbox is however rather a pain to install.
% method 2:			uses a variant of the metaopt toolbox that sometimes can circumvent some numerical troubles
%
% method 3:			use the cobra toolbox for FVA. This method is slower and the numerical precision cannot be tuned.

%By default we use method 3, because it only needs the Cobra Toolbox
