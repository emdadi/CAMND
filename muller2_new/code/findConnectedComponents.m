function C = findConnectedComponents(K)
%FINDCONNECTEDCOMPONENTS interprets K as the adjacency matrix of a
%bipartite graph and finds the connected components in that one
%   returns only the indices of the rows
%
% The bipartite graph contains a node for each columns and row. There is an edge between column i and row j if K(j,i) != 0. 
%
% Input:
%		K		a matrix (values != 0 are considered true, others are considered false). Zero-Test is done using an epsilon of 1e-8
%
% Output:
%		C		a logical matrix encoding the connected components. Each column encodes a connected component. 
%				C(i,j) = true if connected component i contains row j (of K) and false otherwise.
