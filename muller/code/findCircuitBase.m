function [K, B] = findCircuitBase( S )
%FINDCIRCUITBASE Given a matrix S, computes a base of null(S) of circuits.
%
% Input:
%		S				a real matrix
%
% Output:
%		K				a null space matrix of S where each column is a fundamental circuit of the basis B
%		B				a basis of S (maximal set of linearly independent columns of S). The columns are specified by a logical index array.
