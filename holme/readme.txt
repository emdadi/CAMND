Dear Abolfazi,

I'm happy you are interested in my old paper. Of course I don't remember much of this today and I'm slightly ashamed of my programs from those days, but when I checked the code I think I found the answers to your questions at lines 23-28 in net.c

good luck!
Petter

Dear Peter,

I am a PhD student and working on decomposition of metabolic networks and I have read your paper "Subnetwork hierarchies of biochemical pathways". I am now trying to compare existing decomposition methods and need their implementations to run on the same metabolic network models and compare the results.
I checked the page http://www.tp.umu.se/forskning/networks/meta/ for your software. Everything is nice except WIT database at http://wit.mcs.anl.gov/WIT2/ is no longer available and I cannot figure of the format of input files to the algorithm. May you please help me and save me from reimplementing :)

Best Regards,
Abolfazl Rezvan.
